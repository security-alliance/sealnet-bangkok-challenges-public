### Swear Words

For some reason some people are *still* using antiquated methods of mining vanity addresses. Maybe they know something we don't. This one should be pretty straightforward but who can do it fastest?

Instructions: Crack the following addresses and use the virtual testnet RPC to send the funds to the designated asset recovery address.

Measuring success: We should see direct transfers of ETH from the vulnerable addresses to the asset recovery addresses

Addresses:
```
