# The Time Traveling Nomad

You have been transported to September 30, 2022. For most people it's just a normal day in crypto. However you have the opportunity to rewrite history and save $100Ms of user funds.

Instructions: Using the virtual testnet RPC, exploit the Nomad bridge and send the maximum funds possible to the designated asset recovery address.

Measuring success: All funds should be drained from the ERC20 bridge and sent to the asset recovery address.
