# License To Steal

Welcome back to April 8, 2023. While enjoying your Sunday morning you decided to check out the latest router contract deployed by the Sushi devs. You immediately notice something seems off, but how much is really at risk?

Instructions: Using the virtual testnet RPC, exploit the vulnerable router to recover the maximum amount of user funds and send them to the asset recovery address.

Measuring success: We should see tokens stolen from EOAs. We will be monitoring for WETH, USDC, DAI, WBTC and USDT
